# What is a Wanderlink?

A Wanderlink is intended to allow someone to take "the scenic route" when following a link from site-a to site-b on the web. When clicking a Wanderlink to say, example.org, one will be taken to an arbitrary amount of targets before ariving at the example.org destination. A simple software mechanism, such as a desktop application or containing website (for demo purposes), would provide simple navigation controls for the sequence.

The internet is an excellent tool for surface level communication but offers less opportunities for deeper understanding. We need more tools that encourage the former. That is to share in a way that is closer to [groking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok) then understanding.

Why will a chained set of hyperlinks do this? Imagine you are traveling with a friend who you promised a short tour of your home town for the first time. You have the option of taking the shortest route, likely a major highway, to your destination or you can take a few of the "backroads" that you often enjoyed in your youth. The backroads will certainly take longer but will likely provide a better understanding of the person you have become. Can we do something similar online? When saying "Check out my new website" someone could wanderlink "website" to the following chained example inspiration1->inspiration2->context1->website.
