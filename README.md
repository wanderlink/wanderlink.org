# What is a Wanderlink?

A Wanderlink is intended to allow someone to take "the scenic route" when following a link from site a to site b on the web. When clicking a Wanderlink to say, example.org, one will actually be taken to an arbitrary amount of targets before ariving at the example.org destination.A simple software mechanism, such as a desktop application or containing website, would provide a simple navigation area to move through the sequence.

# Inspirations and History
Imagine you are traveling with a friend who will be seeing your home town for the first time. You have the option of taking the shortest route, likely a major highway, to your destination or you can take a few of the "backroads" that you often enjoyed in your youth. The direct route provides efficiency and instant connection but the longer route will provide explanatory value to your friend by allowing him to "walk through your shoes"
